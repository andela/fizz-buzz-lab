Create a function to return `Fizz`, `Buzz`, `FizzBuzz`, or the argument it receives, all depending on the *argument* of the function, a number that is divisible by, **3**, **5**, or both **3** and **5**, respectively.

When the number is not divisible by **3** or **5**, the number itself should be returned.

## Instructions

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!
